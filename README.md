# Culture

At The Left Bit our goal is create the best products for the best clients. We strive to build the best product so it can reach  market and solve real world needs as fast as possible.

We believe that the only way to achieve this is by:
* Defining and iterating over the core value propositions for any required solution. 
* Great software engineering to build the system.
* Preferring quality over quantity.

We've spent years working together, on game-changing projects and products. During this process, we've refined the processes and learned to work together, an now we want to make this know-how available for the best clients. 

We think software is a key asset to any business, and *great* software should be one of your advantages over your competition. Building this in-house is something that would take a lot of time, could lead to a lot of bad hires that would eventually brake your company's culture. Believe us, **we've seen this happen**.

The document you are reading says a lot about The Left Bit's culture: 
* It's written in Markdown.
* It's in a public GIT repository.
* Everyone in the organization has write access.

Ideally, anyone in the company, from the CEO to the Marketing Chief, could modify this document following the same guidelines we use in software development: 

1. Assert that there is room for improvement.
2. Propose changes.
3. Get feedback from your co-workers.

The fact that in Software engineering this steps are referred to as create a branch, commit changes and issue a Pull Request [(source)](http://codeinthehole.com/writing/pull-requests-and-other-good-practices-for-teams-using-github/) are implementation details that should not matter to the process itself, and the fact that we've chosen to put the human readable version as the main one shows you that we know what the [Dependecy Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) is 😉. 

This continous improvement over our **communication** and **feedback processes** are our main building stone.

##Communication

This is the most important trait of any good system, because it allows every person in the system to know as much as possible of the environment, enabling better, smarter and fastest decisions.

Great communication is exercised daily by every member of the team, be it in the Weekly Sync meetings with all the team members, over the Pull Requests, talking to clients or discussing in the whiteboard a technical solution.

This is why every member of The Left Bit has excellent verbal and written communication skills, to benefit the system as a whole.
